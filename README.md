# Raspsaber
## Abstract
This project is an attempt at building a Raspberry-pi controlled lightsaber using the <a href="https://github.com/jgarff/rpi_ws281x">rpi_ws281x library</a> in python. The blade is composed of two addressable NeoPixel ws2812b RGB LEDs strips by Adafruit. The sabre has a sound output provided by a JustBoom DAC zero pHat.
## Introduction
My inner child always wanted a lightsaber, thus one can easily buy one online, most of the fun lies in the homemaking of one. There's a few ways to achieve such project, you can simply use a super-bright LED spot, but you wouldn't be able to have blade animation then or you can use LEDs strip such as <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/1138">Neopixel</a> or <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/2238">DotStar</a> as I did.
